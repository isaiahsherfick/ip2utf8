# utf8toipv4

UTF-8 strings as ip addresses and vice versa

this crate has both a library and two binary packages. The library package
exposes a few basic functions which can be used to convert UTF-8 strings into
ipv4 addresses. This is done by first converting each character/grapheme in the
string into its associated Unicode code point as a base 10 u64 and storing the
non-zero bytes in an array. The first four non-zero bytes from that array are
then converted to an ipv4 address. This functionality is accessible from the
binary crate &rsquo;utf8toipv4&rsquo;.

If you want to figure out what input to utf8toipv4 would result in a given ip
address, you can use the &rsquo;ipv4toutf8&rsquo; binary crate.

The question of which UTF-8 strings will yield a given ip address when fed into
utf8toipv4 is more difficult to answer, as there are thousands of potential
solutions given the way UTF-8 and utf8toipv4 both work. As such, ipv4toutf8
prints out a list of a few UTF-8 strings that will work. Many of these are
hideous and feature a lot of unprintable characters, but that&rsquo;s just the nature
of these things.

## utf8toipv4 (library)

the library exposes the following functions:

    utf8_to_ipv4(&str) -> Result<Vec<String>,Error>,
    
    ipv4_to_utf8(&str) -> Vec<String>,

## utf8toipv4 (binary package)

the utf8toipv4 binary package simply calls the utf8_to_ipv4 function on whatever
string is supplied as a command line argument. This can be piped into xargs and
used as an argument to whatever networking tool you want.

## ipv4toutf8 (binary package)

the ipv4toutf8 binary package simply calls the ipv4_to_utf8 function on whatever
string is supplied as a command line argument. If the string is not a valid ipv4
address, it prints an error. If the string is a valid ipv4 address, it prints
each of the computed solution strings on its own line like so:

    ipv4toutf8 192.168.2.1
    \u{c0}\u{a8}\u{2}\u{1}
    \u{c0}êä®
    ™£Ä\u{1}
    Í£Ä\u{2}\u{1}
    Í£ÄƒÇ
    \u{c0}\u{a8}ƒÇ

By default, most non-printable characters are represented as their ASCII escape
codes. I might add an option to print the raw output in the future, but I don&rsquo;t
want to right now.
