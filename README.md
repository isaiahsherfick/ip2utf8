# ip2utf8

ip addresses as UTF-8 encoded strings and vice versa

this crate has both a library and two binary packages. The library package exposes
a few basic functions which can be used to convert UTF-8 strings into ipv4
addresses. This is done by first converting each character/grapheme in the
string into its associated Unicode code point as a base 10 u64 and storing the
non-zero bytes in an array. The first four non-zero bytes from that array are
then converted to an ipv4 address. The inverse operation is also possible.

## ip2utf8 (library)

the library exposes the following functions:

-   utf8<sub>to</sub><sub>ipv4</sub>(&str) -> String,

-   ipv4<sub>to</sub><sub>utf8</sub>(&str) -> String,

## utf8toipv4 (binary package)

the binary package is called &rsquo;utf8toipv4&rsquo; and simply calls the utf8<sub>to</sub><sub>ipv4</sub>
function on whatever string is supplied as a command line argument. This can be
piped into xargs and used as an argument to whatever networking tool you want.
